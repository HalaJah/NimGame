# NimGame

After attending the Putnam Seminar at my university, I was introduced to the principles of game theory. One exercise on the NimGame piqued my interest, prompting me to explore the game theory reasoning behind it. Consequently, I decided to develop a game bot guaranteed to win every match.
I've already developed the backend, understanding its logic and translating the mathematical principles into Java. I'm still learning ReactJS and Spring Boot, which I intend to use for the user interface development and its integration with the backend. Additionally, I'm considering using a database to store the history of each user's turn.
